The archetypes themselves are restricted to being mixtures of the individuals in the data set. Archetypes are selected by minimizing the squared error in representing each individual as a mixture of archetypes. The usefulness of archetypal analysis is illustrated on several data sets. Computing the archetypes is a nonlinear least squares problem, which is solved using an alternating minimizing algorithm.},

Current ST analysis methods require single-cell RNA sequencing data as a reference for a rigorous interpretation of cell states and do not utilize associated histology images. Significant sample variation further complicates the integration of ST datasets, which is essential for identifying commonalities across tissues or altered cellular wiring in disease. Here, we present Starfysh, the first comprehensive computational toolbox for joint modeling of ST and histology data, dissection of refined cell states, and systematic integration of multiple ST datasets from complex tissues. Starfysh uses an auxiliary deep generative model that incorporates archetypal analysis and any known cell state markers to avoid the need for a single-cell-resolution reference in characterizing known or novel tissue-specific cell states. Additionally, Starfysh improves the characterization of spatial dynamics in complex tissues by leveraging histology images and enables the comparison of niches as spatial “hubs” across tissues. Integrative analysis of primary estrogen receptor-positive (ER             +             ) breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) tumors using Starfysh led to the identification of heterogeneous patient- and disease-specific hubs as well as a shared stromal hub with varying spatial orientation. Our results show the ability to delineate the spatial co-evolution of tumor and immune cell states and their crosstalk underlying intratumoral heterogeneity in TNBC and revealed metabolic reprogramming shaping immunosuppressive hubs in aggressive MBC. Starfysh is publicly available (             https://github.com/azizilab/starfysh             ).},

As such AA favors features that constitute representative ‘corners’ of the data, i.e., distinct aspects or archetypes. We currently show that AA enjoys the interpretability of clustering –without being limited to hard assignment and the uniqueness of SVD – without being limited to orthogonal representations. In order to do large scale AA, we derive an efficient algorithm based on projected gradient as well as an initialization procedure we denote FURTHESTSUM that is inspired by the FURTHESTFIRST approach widely used for K-means (Hochbaum and Shmoys, 1985 [14]). We generalize the AA procedure to KERNEL-AA in order to extract the principal convex hull in potential infinite Hilbert spaces and derive a relaxation of AA when the archetypes cannot be represented as convex combinations of the observed data. We further demonstrate that the AA model is relevant for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction for a large variety of machine learning problems taken from computer vision, neuroimaging, chemistry, text mining and collaborative filtering leading to highly interpretable representations of the dynamics in the data. Matlab code for the derived algorithms is available for download from www.mortenmorup.dk.},

Although many methods and approaches exist, identifying cell states and their underlying topology is still a major challenge. Here, we introduce the concept of multiresolution cell-state decomposition as a practical approach to simultaneously capture both fine- and coarse-grain patterns of variability. We implement this concept in ACTIONet, a comprehensive framework that combines archetypal analysis and manifold learning to provide a ready-to-use analytical approach for multiresolution single-cell state characterization. ACTIONet provides a robust, reproducible, and highly interpretable single-cell analysis platform that couples dominant pattern discovery with a corresponding structural representation of the cell state landscape. Using multiple synthetic and real data sets, we demonstrate ACTIONet’s superior performance relative to existing alternatives. We use ACTIONet to integrate and annotate cells across three human cortex data sets. Through integrative comparative analysis, we define a consensus vocabulary and a consistent set of gene signatures discriminating against the transcriptomic cell types and subtypes of the human prefrontal cortex.},

To address this, we combine ideas from community ecology and machine learning into niche-phenotype mapping (NIPMAP). NIPMAP takes advantage of geometric constraints on local cellular composition imposed by the niche structure of tissues in order to automatically segment tissue sections into niches and their interfaces. Projecting phenotypes on niches and their interfaces identifies previously-reported and previously-unreported spatially-driven phenotypes, concisely summarizes the phenotypic architecture of tissues, and reveals fundamental properties of tissue architecture. NIPMAP is applicable to both protein and RNA multiplex histology of healthy and diseased tissue. An open-source R/Python package implements NIPMAP.},

Utilizing probabilistic ideas from high-dimensional geometry, we introduce two preprocessing techniques to reduce the dimension and representation cardinality of the data, respectively. We prove that provided data are approximately embedded in a low-dimensional linear subspace and the convex hull of the corresponding representations is well approximated by a polytope with a few vertices, our method can effectively reduce the scaling of AA. Moreover, the solution of the reduced problem is near-optimal in terms of prediction errors. Our approach can be combined with other acceleration techniques to further mitigate the intrinsic complexity of AA. We demonstrate the usefulness of our results by applying our method to summarize several moderately large-scale datasets.},

Because transplants are frequently biopsied, they present an opportunity to explore the full spectrum of kidney response-to-wounding from all causes. Defining parenchymal damage in transplanted organs is important for clinical management because it determines function and survival. In this study, we classified the scenarios associated with parenchymal injury in genome-wide microarray results from 1,526 kidney transplant indication biopsies collected during the INTERCOMEX study. We defined injury groups by using archetypal analysis (AA) of scores for gene sets and classifiers previously identified in various injury states. Six groups and their characteristics were defined in this population: No injury, minor injury, two classes of acute kidney injury (“AKI,” AKI1, and AKI2), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and CKD combined with AKI. We compared the two classes of AKI, namely, AKI1 and AKI2. AKI1 had a poor function and increased parenchymal dedifferentiation but minimal response-to-injury and inflammation, instead having increased expression of PARD3, a gene previously characterized as being related to epithelial polarity and adherens junctions. In contrast, AKI2 had a poor function and increased response-to-injury, significant inflammation, and increased macrophage activity. In random forest analysis, the most important predictors of function (estimated glomerular filtration rate) and graft loss were injury-based molecular scores, not rejection scores. AKI1 and AKI2 differed in 3-year graft survival, with better survival in the AKI2 group. Thus, injury archetype analysis of injury-induced gene expression shows new heterogeneity in kidney response-to-wounding, revealing AKI1, a class of early transplants with a poor function but minimal inflammation or response to injury, a deviant response characterized as PC3, and an increased risk of failure. Given the relationship between parenchymal injury and kidney survival, further characterization of the injury phenotypes in kidney transplants will be important for an improved understanding that could have implications for understanding native kidney diseases (               ClinicalTrials.gov               \#NCT01299168).},

The vertices are further enriched with proteins that occupy different subcellular compartments, namely, cytoplasmic, inner membrane, outer membrane, and outer membrane bounded periplasmic space. The combination of various enriching features offers an interpretation of how bacteria use the physico-chemical properties of proteins, both to drive them into their final destination in the cell and to have their tasks accomplished.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The evolution of resistance in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cells following chemotherapy is only partially understood. To understand the selection of factors driving heterogeneity before and through adaptation to treatment, we profile single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) transcriptomes of HGSOC tumors collected longitudinally during therapy. We analyze scRNA-seq data from two independent patient cohorts to reveal that HGSOC is driven by three archetypal phenotypes, defined as oncogenic states that describe the majority of the transcriptome variation. Using a multi-task learning approach to identify the biological tasks of each archetype, we identify metabolism and proliferation, cellular defense response, and DNA repair signaling as consistent cell states found across patients. Our analysis demonstrates a shift in favor of the metabolism and proliferation archetype versus cellular defense response archetype in cancer cells that received multiple lines of treatment. While archetypes are not consistently associated with specific whole-genome driver mutations, they are closely associated with subclonal populations at the single-cell level, indicating that subclones within a tumor often specialize in unique biological tasks. Our study reveals the core archetypes found in progressive HGSOC and shows consistent enrichment of subclones with the metabolism and proliferation archetype as resistance is acquired to multiple lines of therapy.},

In this paper we revisit archetypal analysis from the basic principles, and propose a probabilistic framework that accommodates other observation types such as integers, binary, and probability vectors. We corroborate the proposed methodology with convincing real-world applications on finding archetypal soccer players based on performance data, archetypal winter tourists based on binary survey data, archetypal disaster-affected countries based on disaster count data, and document archetypes based on term-frequency data. We also present an appropriate visualization tool to summarize archetypal analysis solution better.},

Due to local minima, a good initialization is essential, but frequently used initialization methods yield either sub-optimal starting points or are prone to get stuck in poor local minima. In this paper, we propose archetypal analysis++ (AA++), a probabilistic initialization strategy for archetypal analysis that sequentially samples points based on their influence on the objective function, similar to k-means++. In fact, we argue that k-means++ already approximates the proposed initialization method. Furthermore, we suggest to adapt an efficient Monte Carlo approximation of k-means++ to AA++. In an extensive empirical evaluation of 15 real-world data sets of varying sizes and dimensionalities and considering two pre-processing strategies, we show that AA++ almost always outperforms all baselines, including the most frequently used ones.},

However, existing methods are computationally-intensive, prohibitively so in the case of nationwide biobanks. Here we explore Archetypal Analysis as an efficient, unsupervised approach for identifying genetic clusters and for associating individuals with them. Such unsupervised approaches help avoid conflating socially constructed ethnic labels with genetic clusters by eliminating the need for exogenous training labels. We show that Archetypal Analysis yields similar cluster structure to existing unsupervised methods such as ADMIXTURE and provides interpretative advantages. More importantly, we show that since Archetypal Analysis can be used with lower-dimensional representations of genetic data, significant reductions in computational time and memory requirements are possible. When Archetypal Analysis is run in such a fashion, it takes several orders of magnitude less compute time than the current standard, ADMIXTURE. Finally, we demonstrate uses ranging across datasets from humans to canids.},

  abstract = {Archetypes represent extreme manifestations of a population with respect to specific characteristic traits or features. In linear feature space, archetypes approximate the data convex hull allowing all data points to be expressed as convex mixtures of archetypes. As mixing of archetypes is performed directly on the input data, linear Archetypal Analysis requires additivity of the input, which is a strong assumption unlikely to hold e.g. in case of image data. To address this problem, we propose learning an appropriate latent feature space while simultaneously identifying suitable archetypes. We thus introduce a generative formulation of the linear archetype model, parameterized by neural networks. By introducing the distance-dependent archetype loss, the linear archetype model can be integrated into the latent space of a deep variational information bottleneck and an optimal representation, together with the archetypes, can be learned end-to-end. Moreover, the information bottleneck framework allows for a natural incorporation of arbitrarily complex side information during training. As a consequence, learned archetypes become easily interpretable as they derive their meaning directly from the included side information. Applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated by exploring archetypes of female facial expressions while using multi-rater based emotion scores of these expressions as side information. A second application illustrates the exploration of the chemical space of small organic molecules. By using different kinds of side information we demonstrate how identified archetypes, along with their interpretation, largely depend on the side information provided.},

On the application side, this allows us to unify a large variety of existing sparse greedy methods, in particular for optimization over convex hulls of an atomic set, even if those sets can only be approximated, including sparse (or structured sparse) vectors or matrices, low-rank matrices, permutation matrices, or max-norm bounded matrices.    We present a new general framework for convex optimization over matrix factorizations, where every Frank-Wolfe iteration will consist of a low-rank update, and discuss the broad application areas of this approach.},

  abstract = {High-throughput multi-omic molecular profiling allows the probing of biological systems at unprecedented resolution. However, integrating and interpreting high-dimensional, sparse, and noisy multimodal datasets remains challenging. Deriving new biological insights with current methods is difficult because they are not rooted in biological principles but prioritise tasks like dimensionality reduction. Here, we introduce a framework that combines archetypal analysis, an approach grounded in biological principles, with deep learning. Using archetypes based on evolutionary trade-offs and Pareto optimality, MIDAA finds extreme data points that define the geometry of the latent space, preserving the complexity of biological interactions while retaining an interpretable output. We demonstrate that these extreme points represent cellular programmes reflecting the underlying biology. Moreover, we show that, compared to alternative methods, MIDAA can identify parsimonious, interpretable, and biologically relevant patterns from real and simulated multi-omics.},

This work presents a computationally efficient greedy AA (GAA) algorithm. GAA leverages the underlying geometry of AA, is scalable to larger datasets, and has significantly faster convergence rate. To achieve this, archetypes are learned via sparse projection of data. In the transformed space, GAA employs an iterative subset selection approach to identify archetypes based on the sparsity of convex representations. The work further presents the use of GAA algorithm for extended AA models such as robust and kernel AA. Experimental results show that GAA is considerably faster while performing comparable to existing methods for tasks such as classification, data visualization/categorization.},

We provide theoretical and empirical results for our proposed approach and make use of the frame to accelerate Archetypal Analysis.

  abstract = {Archetypal analysis is an unsupervised learning approach which represents data by convex combinations of a set of archetypes. The archetypes generally correspond to the extremal points in the dataset and are learned by requiring them to be convex combinations of the training data. In spite of its nice property of interpretability, the method is slow. We propose a variant of archetypal analysis which scales gracefully to large datasets. The core idea is to decouple the binding between data and archetypes and require them to be unit normalized. Geometrically, the method learns a convex hull inside the unit sphere and represents the data by their projections on the closest surfaces of the convex hull. By minimizing the representation error, the method pushes the convex hull surfaces close to the regions of the sphere where the data reside. The vertices of the convex hull are the learned archetypes. We apply the method to human faces and poses to validate its effectiveness in the context of reconstructions and classifications.},

AA thereby provides straightforward, interpretable, and explainable representations for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, facilitating the understanding of the structure of high-dimensional data with wide applications throughout the sciences. However, AA also faces challenges, particularly as the associated optimization problem is non-convex. This survey provides researchers and data mining practitioners an overview of methodologies and opportunities that AA has to offer surveying the many applications of AA across disparate fields of science, as well as best practices for modeling data using AA and limitations. The survey concludes by explaining important future research directions concerning AA.},

AA thereby forms a polytope representing trade-offs of the distinct aspects in the data. Most existing methods for AA are designed for continuous data and do not exploit the structure of the data distribution. In this paper, we propose two new optimization frameworks for archetypal analysis for binary data. i) A second order approximation of the AA likelihood based on the Bernoulli distribution with efficient closed-form updates using an active set procedure for learning the convex combinations defining the archetypes, and a sequential minimal optimization strategy for learning the observation specific reconstructions. ii) A Bernoulli likelihood based version of the principal convex hull analysis (PCHA) algorithm originally developed for least squares optimization. We compare these approaches with the only existing binary AA procedure relying on multiplicative updates and demonstrate their superiority on both synthetic and real binary data. Notably, the proposed optimization frameworks for AA can easily be extended to other data distributions providing generic efficient optimization frameworks for AA based on tailored likelihood functions reflecting the underlying data distribution.},

The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the associated area under the curve (AUC) have been reported as ill-suited to evaluate prediction performance on imbalanced problems where there is more interest in performance on the positive minority class, while the precision-recall (PR) curve is preferable. We show via simulation and a real case study that this is a misinterpretation of the difference between the ROC and PR spaces, showing that the ROC curve is robust to class imbalance, while the PR curve is highly sensitive to class imbalance. Furthermore, we show that class imbalance cannot be easily disentangled from classifier performance measured via PR-AUC.},

Given a nonnegative data matrix \$X\$, SPA identifies an index set \$\textbackslash mathcal\{K\}\$ such that there exists a nonnegative matrix \$H\$ with \$X \textbackslash approx X(:,\textbackslash mathcal\{K\})H\$. SPA has been successfully used as a pure-pixel search algorithm in hyperspectral unmixing and for anchor word selection in document classification. Moreover, SPA is provably robust in low-noise settings. The main drawbacks of SPA are that it is not robust to outliers and does not take the data fitting term into account when selecting the indices in \$\textbackslash mathcal\{K\}\$. In this paper, we propose a new SPA variant, dubbed Robust SPA (RSPA), that is robust to outliers while still being provably robust in low-noise settings, and that takes into account the reconstruction error for selecting the indices in \$\textbackslash mathcal\{K\}\$. We illustrate the effectiveness of RSPA on synthetic data sets and hyperspectral images.},

Despite the sustained effort to make IG methods more data-efficient, it remains an open question how to select a training data subset that can theoretically and practically perform on par with the full dataset. Here we develop CRAIG, a method to select a weighted subset (or coreset) of training data that closely estimates the full gradient by maximizing a submodular function. We prove that applying IG to this subset is guaranteed to converge to the (near)optimal solution with the same convergence rate as that of IG for convex optimization. As a result, CRAIG achieves a speedup that is inversely proportional to the size of the subset. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous method for data-efficient training of general machine learning models. Our extensive set of experiments show that CRAIG, while achieving practically the same solution, speeds up various IG methods by up to 6x for logistic regression and 3x for training deep neural networks.},
